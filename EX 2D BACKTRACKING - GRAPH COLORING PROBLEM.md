# EX 2D BACKTRACKING - GRAPH COLORING PROBLEM
## DATE: 15/03/2025
## AIM:
To solve the Graph Coloring Problem using backtracking, assigning colors to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color while minimizing the number of colors used.

## Algorithm
1. Input:
   - A graph represented by an adjacency matrix.
   - An integer m â€” maximum number of colors allowed.
2. Initialize:
   - Set all vertex colors to 0 (unassigned).
   - Start coloring from the first vertex (v = 0).
3. Recursive Coloring (graphColourUtil):
   - If all vertices are assigned a color (i.e., v == V), return True.
   - For each color c from 1 to m:
   - Check if color c can be assigned to vertex v using isSafe:
   - Make sure no adjacent vertex has color c.
4. If safe:
   - Assign color c to vertex v.
   - Recur for the next vertex v + 1.
   - If recursion returns True, propagate success upward.
   - Else, backtrack: remove color (colour[v] = 0).
5. No Solution:
   - If no color leads to a valid solution, return False.
6. Print Result:
   - If a solution exists, print the assigned colors for each vertex.

            return False
        print ("Solution exist and Following are the assigned colours:")
        for c in colour:
            print (c,end=' ')

## Result:
The Graph Coloring program executed successfully, and the colors were assigned to the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
